## This is coding assignment Task 

I have Fetch() method to get the data from backend.

I have created Functions which take selected values dynamically and show when show message when Add to cart button is clicked.

I have created almost Every Functionality which was required.

NOTE: I viewed Email so late and i do not get that much time so Except Responsiveness i have implemented all functionality.
Images from backend was not workin so i have to past url which was to much big, it seems to be bad practice but what else i can do at that time.
